## Your trustworthy friend – the Flintlock pistol

A pirate is nobody without his flintlock pistol, a single-shot gun who is famous among pirates of this caliber. Howewer, in this game, your pistol is always loaded and can shoot whenever you want.

With this pistol, you can shoot at everything, however only certain objects will have a tangible effect and change the world around you: targets and boxes,
- Targets :dart: &ensp;→ when hit, they can activate contraptions
- Boxes :package: &emsp;→ a box can be moved with a shot of the pistol or with your own body; the box is helpful for keeping on a button

## Rum – a Gulp and a Leap
<!-- come se fosse un modo di dire rivisto per i pirati -->

The Rum bottle is a powerful tool being able to give you some powers, however it can only be found near the end of the game.

When you take a sip of this fine Rum, your body feels lighter so you can run and jump much more freely and your eyes gain a new power: to see platforms hidden to the naked eye. <br>
Nevertheless all the effects will fade with time and you will be hungover, with an eyestrain which will obfuscate your view. It will take some time to get back to normal again. <br>
:warning: Be cautious, because the **more** you drink it, the **less** the effects will last!
